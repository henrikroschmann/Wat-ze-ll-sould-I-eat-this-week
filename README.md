 Project Proposal C# course Malm√∂ university
Every day there is the same question over and over again, what should we eat. If we zoom out the question is even bigger on a weekly basis, what should we eat this week. This tool will help you in that quest.
The tool is a desktop application that will pull some recipes from the internet and display them in the following format: Description, image, steps. This will be presented in a listview and by clicking on the item some more details will be given. 
Once done you will be able to select up to 7 recipes to create the shopping list. 
-	Ingredient will be grouped on the shoppling list, no duplication. 
-	Ingredients can also be categorized by area.
